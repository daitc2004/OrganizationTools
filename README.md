# Multi Account Org Setup

Tools to setup Multi-account permissions using AWS Organizations servcice control policies and SSO Permissions Policies.

## Scripts

  * **`update-scp.py`**: updates SCP in the Organization from local SCP files.

  * **`sso`**: directory containing AWS SSO Permissions Policies. 
    This is synced manually using AWS Console, since the SSO API is not public.
